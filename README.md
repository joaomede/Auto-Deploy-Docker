## ABOUT
This is a mechanism to auto deploy systems that are completely isolated in docker containers and are in the Docker Hub, it works with the official WebHook of the docker, so that this is possible, I created a backend routine, a restful api and a web interface to facilitate the configuration of the docker template and allow security authentication.
